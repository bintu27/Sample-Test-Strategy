# Sample-Test-Strategy

**Unit Testing** :- Testing that is an interal part of the application code and is designed to excercise individual operation(s) within a single component e.g method


**Functional testing** :- Validates functionality of a component or system. Functional test scope should draw heavily upon Agile team collaboration and Test Analysis techniques, typically considering all possbile inputs (vaild and invaild), and all possible Outputs (success, error messages, update , logs etc.) of the Compoent or system.

Functional Acceptance Tests provide evidence to the Product Ownner that the system has been built to the correct specification. ideally the PO, Software and Quality Engineers should collaborate to desgin the functaional Tests before the Application code is written.

**Note A:** Functional test scope may infulence Unit test scope
**Note B:** Functional Testing will be performed on parts of system before the system is intergareted
